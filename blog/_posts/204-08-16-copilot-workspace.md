## X reasons you're going to love Copilot Workspace

I've been lucky enough to have access to the technical preview of [GitHub Copilot Workspace](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace) for the last month, and I'm having a blast so far!

While this is not the magic 'write a prompt, press the button and a finished piece of software pops out' app you might be dreaming of, it does represent a potentially huge leap forward in abstracting developer tasks within a natural language UI. And since I've had it, I'm having fun tackling tasks that previously fell into the 'too hard to give up my evening hours for' category.

### Tips and Tricks

https://github.com/githubnext/copilot-workspace-user-manual/blob/main/tips-and-tricks.md

### 1. Everything is made to be edited and re-run

### 2. It features Undo/Redo

### 3. Any edits made directly in your Workspace session or Codespace are synced

### 4. You can share your sessions with others

### 5. It works great on mobile

### 6. You can trigger off Issues in a separate repo to your code (or vice versa)
