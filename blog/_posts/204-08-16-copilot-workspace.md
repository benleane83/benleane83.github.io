## X reasons you're going to love Copilot Workspace

I've been lucky enough to have access to the technical preview of [GitHub Copilot Workspace](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace) for the last month, and I'm having a blast so far!

While this is not the magic 'write a prompt, press the button and a finished piece of software pops out' app you might be dreaming of, it does represent a potentially huge leap forward in abstracting developer tasks within a natural language UI. And since I've had it, I'm having fun tackling tasks that previously fell into the 'too hard to give up my evening hours for' category.
