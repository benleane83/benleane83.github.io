## Blogging with Copilot

- Trying out Workspace ahead of the technical preview

- Used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and Codespaces to work across multiple PCs without installing any Ruby/Jekyll tooling myself. I have VS Code on Settings Sync so it brings Copilot and other extensions I need each time I'm creating a Codespace.

- Once my repo is setup, GitHub Actions is happily building and deploying my static site on each push to main

- Used to fix obscure errors such as invalid characters in my Markdown Front Matter header that was crashing out page

- Used Chat to get smaller tips such as syntax (because the Hydejack docs are in my repo as Markdown, they're used as context for workspace questions)
